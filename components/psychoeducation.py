    😊 **Doing Well** - Generally good mood, occasional stress

    **Before your appointment or conversation:**
    
    • Write down your symptoms and when they started
    • Note what makes them better or worse
    • List any medications you're taking
    • Think about your goals for treatment
    • Prepare questions you want to ask
    • Consider bringing a trusted person for support
    
    **What to expect:**
    • The professional will ask about your symptoms and history
    • They may ask about family mental health history
    • Everything you share is confidential (with rare exceptions for safety)
    • Treatment often involves both therapy and sometimes medication
    • It may take time to find the right treatment approach
