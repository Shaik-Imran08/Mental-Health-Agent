Add core features for mental wellness chatbot application

This commit introduces the main application structure in `app.py`, including session state management for anonymous users, Streamlit page configuration, and navigation setup. It also includes the implementation of various components: `chat_interface` for AI-driven conversations with persona selection and crisis detection, `mood_tracker` for logging and visualizing moods, `journal_prompts` for guided reflection, `cbt_exercises` for thought records and pattern identification, `breathing_exercises` for mindfulness practices, and `psychoeducation` for mental health learning. Additionally, it configures Streamlit server settings in `.streamlit/config.toml`, adds data structures for CBT prompts and crisis keywords in `data/cbt_prompts.py` and `data/crisis_keywords.py`, respectively.
